# Reporting Security Issues

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for public code repositories
in the `transferwise/*` organization.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you have found a security issue in one of our public repositories, we ask you to report it
through our responsible disclosure program. You can find the full description of the program
from [transferwise.com/responsible-disclosure](https://transferwise.com/responsible-disclosure).

Your report will be triaged and responded to in Bugcrowd.

### Alternative means of contact

If you prefer to get in touch via e-mail, the contact details of our SOC are available
from [transferwise.com/security.txt](https://transferwise.com/.well-known/security.txt).

Note that direct reports over e-mail will not reach our managed bug bounty program and
are not rewardable.
